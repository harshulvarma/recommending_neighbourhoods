### Overview

In this project I want to make a tool for home movers to find similiar neighbourhoods in Toronto. In order to do so following tasks were done:
- Scraped and cleaned Toronto postal code, neighbourhoods, and borough data from wikipedia.
- Added Toronto population data through open data portal from census
- Retrieved popular venues using Foursquare API using geo coordinates of each postal area and grouped key venue categories
- Clustered Toronto neighbourhoods based on above features
- Computed Euclidean distance and cosine similiarities to recommend neighbourhoods

Future changes include addition of census data such as demographics, economics etc. to find even more similiarities within neighbourhoods. To find similiar neighbourhoods I will also explore recommender systems such as collaborative filtering. Lastly the notebook will be deployed as an interactive tool for user to be recommeneded neighbourhoods.

### Tools Utilised:
